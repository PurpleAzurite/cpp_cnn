# cnn_probe
This is prototype for a neural network I'm developing for medical diagnosis purposes. It has a live environment for 3D rendering with OpenGL, as well as a neural network component currently training to be a simple XOR gate.
The modular design of the application gives it flexibility to swap out any component to fit the use-case.
